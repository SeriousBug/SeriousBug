- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Bulgur Cloud](https://github.com/SeriousBug/bulgur-cloud), a self-hosted cloud storage and sharing solution, similar to Google Drive or NextCloud.
- 🛠️ I love to work with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), TypeScript, and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).
- 🌱 I'm learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), which is very cool because it lets you write web apps that compile to simple JavaScript.
- 💬 Outside of work, I love to cook and experiment with dishes, play video games (most recently RuneScape), and crochet. Hit me up if you want ot chat!
- 🎓 I graduated from the Ohio State University with an MS in Computer Science. You can find [my publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tHrUCC4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) online.
